## Hello world, I‚Äôm Elena!

A year ago, I genuinely believed that to center a div, you had to sacrifice coffee and perform an ancient ritual, dancing around your monitor.

Fate looked at me and said: ‚ÄúHold on. Here‚Äôs a ticket to another life.‚Äù

I won a place in a professional training program. That was a sign.

From the world of QA testing and technical writing, I ended up in frontend‚Ä¶ and got lost.

Turns out, behind lines of code there isn‚Äôt just dry logic, but the magic of creativity! It felt like a superpower.

Now I‚Äôm a junior with an unstoppable drive to build awesome things and looking for opportunities to grow in a frontend role.
